# arduinoHovercraft
I made a Hovercraft that can swerve left to right with a servo motor. A brushless DC Motor makes it float so that the frictions decreases and another one pushes it forward or backwards.

STM32 requiered, 1 servo motor and 2 brushless DC motors.
individual PIN configuration could be requiered due to different standpoints.

# arduinoHovercraft

NOT OPTIMISED FOR USAGE. THIS IS JUST A UPLOAD FOR DEMONSTRATION.
I made this in school and it isn't well written or made for share.
Keep this in mind!

I made a Hovercraft that can swerve left to right with a servo motor. A brushless DC Motor makes it float so that the frictions decreases and another one pushes it forward or backwards.

STM32, 1 servo motor and 2 brushless DC motors required.
individual PIN configuration could be requiered due to different standpoints.

GFS is the main running file
